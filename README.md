# Advanced Excel Projects

This repository showcases my Advanced Excel projects, which focus on data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The projects demonstrate my ability to work with large datasets, clean and structure data, and derive meaningful insights using Excelâ€™s advanced functionalities like Pivot Tables, Power Query, Charts, and Formulas.

1. Capstone Project (Capstone1.xlsx)
The capstone project is based on a dataset. The goal is to analyze order and delivery data to extract insights related to customer behavior, delivery performance, and order success rates.
